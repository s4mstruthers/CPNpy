"""Descriptive statistics of an event log.

Before discovering anything it pays to *look* at the log: how many cases,
how many distinct behaviours (variants), which activities start and end
cases, how long cases take.  This module computes those numbers once so the
views can display them without recomputing.

Variants
--------
A *variant* is a distinct activity sequence.  Two cases belong to the same
variant iff they have exactly the same sequence under the chosen classifier.
The number of variants relative to the number of cases is a quick measure of
how structured the process is: 1 variant means perfectly repetitive; one
variant per case means every case is unique (a "spaghetti" process).
