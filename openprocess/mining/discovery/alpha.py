"""The α-algorithm (van der Aalst, Weijters & Maruster, 2004).

The eight steps (book, Definition 6.4), for a log L over activities T:

1. ``T_L = { t | t occurs in some trace }``                  -- the transitions
2. ``T_I = { t | t is the first activity of some trace }``   -- start activities
3. ``T_O = { t | t is the last activity of some trace }``    -- end activities
4. ``X_L = { (A, B) | A ⊆ T_L, A ≠ ∅, B ⊆ T_L, B ≠ ∅,
   ∀a∈A ∀b∈B: a →_L b,  ∀a1,a2∈A: a1 #_L a2,  ∀b1,b2∈B: b1 #_L b2 }``
5. ``Y_L = { (A, B) ∈ X_L | no (A', B') ∈ X_L with A ⊆ A', B ⊆ B', (A,B) ≠ (A',B') }``
   -- keep only the *maximal* pairs
6. ``P_L = { p_(A,B) | (A,B) ∈ Y_L } ∪ { i_L, o_L }``
7. ``F_L`` connects every ``a ∈ A`` to ``p_(A,B)``, ``p_(A,B)`` to every ``b ∈ B``,
   ``i_L`` to every start activity and every end activity to ``o_L``
8. ``α(L) = (P_L, T_L, F_L)``

Intuition for step 4: a place between A and B must be *fed* by the
activities in A and *consumed* by those in B.  Every a must cause every b
(``→``), and no two members of A (or of B) may ever be seen together in
either order (``#``) -- if they were, they would be concurrent, and a single
place would wrongly force a choice between them.  ``a1 # a2`` with
``a1 = a2`` forces ``a # a``, which is why an activity in a length-one loop
(``a > a``) can never be in any pair.

Known limitations, reported by :func:`alpha_miner` as warnings:

* **length-one loops** (``a > a``) -- the activity ends up disconnected;
* **length-two loops** (``a b a``) -- ``a > b`` and ``b > a`` make them look
  parallel, so the loop is lost;
* non-free-choice constructs and duplicate or silent activities cannot be
  represented at all.

The result object keeps every intermediate set so the app can show the
derivation step by step -- exactly how exam questions ask for it.
