"""Compare two Petri nets on behaviour, not on how they are drawn.

Two nets *behave the same* when they have the same **complete traces**:
the sequences of visible labels of the firing sequences that lead from the
initial marking to the final marking.  Silent (τ) transitions leave no
trace, and transitions are matched by label, so a net laid out differently
from another -- or with other place names, or an extra τ -- still matches.

How
---
Each net is turned into an automaton over labels: its states are markings,
τ-steps are free moves, and a state accepts when it is the final marking.
Removing the τ-steps and making the automaton deterministic (the subset
construction) gives, for each sequence of labels, the set of markings it can
lead to.  Both automata are explored together, breadth-first, so the first
sequence found that one accepts and the other does not is a **shortest
differing trace**.

* For **bounded** nets both reachability graphs are finite, so this is
  exact: when nothing differs, the languages are equal.
* For **unbounded** nets (or ones too large to explore) only traces up to a
  length limit are compared, and the result says so.

When does a net *end*?  At its final marking if it has one; for a WF-net
without one, at one token in the sink; otherwise in any marking where
nothing is enabled.  A net with no tokens that is a WF-net starts from one
token in its source.

Labels are compared after trimming spaces and ignoring case; a mapping can
rename one net's labels to the other's (``register`` → ``Register request``).
