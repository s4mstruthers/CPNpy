"""Optional packages, installed from inside the app.

Some boxes need a package the app does not ship (pandas, numpy, scipy,
matplotlib).  From a Python install, the app runs ``pip`` in that Python.
The downloaded app has a Python of its own with no pip on any path and no
writable site-packages, so it carries pip inside, runs it in a copy of
itself (``OpenProcess --pip install …``), and installs into a folder of
the user's own (:func:`user_site`), which :func:`activate` puts on the import
path at start-up and right after an install.  Either way the boxes that
need the package come alive without a restart.
