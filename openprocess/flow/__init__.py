"""Workflows: boxes, their connections, and running them reproducibly.

A box is a Python function with type hints::

    from openprocess.flow import box, EventLog, PetriNet

    @box(group="Discover")
    def my_miner(log: EventLog, threshold: float = 0.5) -> PetriNet:
        \"\"\"The help text.\"\"\"
        ...

A workflow is boxes wired together, built on the canvas, in a file, or in
Python::

    from openprocess.flow import Workflow, Runner, save
    from openprocess.flow.boxes.input import typed_log
    from openprocess.flow.boxes.discover import inductive_miner
    from openprocess.flow.boxes.check import check_fit

    wf = Workflow("demo")
    log = wf.add(typed_log, {"text": "[<a,b,c,d>^3, <a,c,b,d>^2, <a,e,d>]"})
    model = wf.add(inductive_miner)
    fit = wf.add(check_fit)
    wf.connect(log, model); wf.connect(model, fit, "model"); wf.connect(log, fit, "log")
    run = Runner().run(wf)
    print(run.value(fit).metrics)
    save(wf, "demo.cpnflow", run)      # with the record that makes it reproducible

See ``docs/workflows.md``.
