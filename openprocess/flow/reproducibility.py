"""Is this analysis reproducible, right now?  One status for the header.

The record (:mod:`openprocess.flow.record`) is a file; this turns it into a
visible promise.  :func:`status` compares the record with the world now
(the inputs' fingerprints, the box files, the seeds, the versions) and with
the latest run (every box's result against its recorded fingerprint), and
says one of:

* **Not recorded yet** -- the analysis has never been saved with a run;
* **Recorded · this run reproduces it** -- every result matches the record and
  nothing it depends on has changed;
* **Recorded · n changes since** -- an input file, a box file, a seed or a
  version differs from the record (a re-run may give other numbers);
* **This run differs from the record** -- the same inputs gave another result.
