"""Binding search: deciding which transitions can fire, and with what values.

The problem
-----------
A transition's arc inscriptions contain free variables.  ``(x, n)`` on an input
arc does not say *which* token to take -- it says "take any token whose value
fits this shape, and let ``x`` and ``n`` be its parts".  Before we can fire
anything we must find every assignment of values to variables such that the
consumed tokens are actually present and the guard holds.  Such an assignment
is a **binding**, and a transition plus a binding is a **binding element**.

The naive method -- enumerate the Cartesian product of every variable's colour
set and test each combination -- is correct but hopeless: three variables over
a 100-element colour set is a million candidates per transition per step.

The method used here
--------------------
**Pattern-directed search with backtracking.**  We read each input arc
inscription as a *pattern* and match it against the tokens that are really in
the place, which yields the variable values directly instead of guessing them.

Concretely, an arc inscription is first decomposed into terms::

    2`(x, n) ++ 1`y      ->   [ (2, (x,n)), (1, y) ]

Each term becomes one *demand*: "take this many tokens of this shape from this
place".  Demands are then satisfied one at a time, depth first:

1. Pick the next unsatisfied demand.
2. If its value expression is a pattern, try each distinct value still
   available in that place, matching to extend the binding; recurse.
3. If it is not a pattern (``1`(n+1)``, say), it can only be *evaluated*, so we
   defer it until its variables are bound by other demands, then check that
   enough copies are present.
4. When every demand is satisfied, enumerate any variables that are still free
   -- ones appearing only in the guard, the output arcs, or the time
   expression -- over their declared colour sets.
5. Evaluate the guard.  If it holds, we have a binding element.

Backtracking happens naturally: if a choice at step 2 leads to a dead end
further down, the loop simply tries the next candidate value.

Consumption bookkeeping
-----------------------
Two demands may draw on the same place -- either two terms of one inscription,
or two arcs from the same place to the same transition.  A ``remaining``
multiset per place is threaded through the search so that a token cannot be
counted twice.

Limits, stated honestly
-----------------------
Step 4 needs a *finite* colour set.  A variable that appears only on an output
arc and is typed ``INT`` cannot be enumerated, and we raise a clear error
naming the variable rather than looping forever.  In practice such variables
are either bound by an input arc or declared over a finite colour set, which is
also what CPN Tools requires.
