"""The Coloured Petri Net data model.

Structure
---------
A model (:class:`CPNet`) owns a declaration block and a list of
:class:`Page` objects.  Each page holds :class:`Place`, :class:`Transition` and
:class:`Arc` objects.  Objects are identified by an opaque string ``id`` that
is stable across save/load, because arcs refer to their endpoints by id and
CPN Tools' file format does the same.

Two representations of every inscription
----------------------------------------
Each inscription (initial marking, arc expression, guard, time delay) is kept
twice:

* as the **source text** the modeller typed -- this is what gets saved and what
  the editor shows;
* as a **parsed AST**, produced lazily by :meth:`CPNet.compile` -- this is what
  the simulator runs.

Keeping the text authoritative means a model with one broken inscription still
loads, still displays, and still lets you fix the broken bit, instead of
failing to open at all.  Compilation errors are collected in
:attr:`CPNet.errors` rather than raised.

Graphics
--------
Layout attributes (position, size, colours, fonts) are carried on
:class:`Graphics` so that the GUI has somewhere to read and write them, and so
that a file round-trips looking the same.  The reader additionally stashes the
original XML element on each object (``source_element``), which lets the writer
preserve attributes this implementation does not model.
