"""Filtering event logs: keep the part of the log you want to look at.

Real logs are messy: rare variants, noise activities, cases cut off by the
extraction window.  Filtering is therefore the usual first step before
discovery, as in ProM ("Filter Log using Simple Heuristics") and Disco.  Every
filter here returns a **new** log and never changes the original, so you can
always compare the filtered log with the one it came from.

The filters, in the order :func:`apply_filters` applies them:

1. **Time frame** -- keep cases *contained in*, *started in*, or
   *intersecting* a period.  Cases without timestamps cannot be placed in
   time and are dropped.
2. **Start and end activities** -- keep cases that start (end) with one of
   the chosen activities, e.g. to drop cases cut off by the extraction.
3. **Activities** -- three modes, as in Disco:

   * *keep events*: remove every event of the other activities (a projection;
     cases keep their other events);
   * *mandatory*: keep cases that contain at least one of the activities;
   * *forbidden*: keep cases that contain none of them.

4. **Case length** -- keep cases with between ``min`` and ``max`` events.
5. **Variants** -- keep the most frequent variants, either the top ``k`` or
   as many as needed to cover a percentage of the cases.

Activities, variants and lengths are seen through the log's *classifier*
(see :mod:`.log`), so they match what the rest of the app shows.
