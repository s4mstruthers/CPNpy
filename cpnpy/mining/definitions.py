"""Mathematical definitions of every property the analyses report.

This is the single source for

* ``docs/definitions.md`` -- generated from this module with
  ``python -m cpnpy.mining.definitions > docs/definitions.md`` (a test checks
  that the file is up to date), where GitHub renders the maths; and
* the pop-ups in the app: hover over or click a property in an Analysis tab
  to see its definition, typeset by :mod:`cpnpy.gui.studio.mathtext`.

Formulas are written in a small subset of LaTeX that both GitHub (MathJax)
and the app's renderer understand; :mod:`cpnpy.gui.studio.mathtext` lists it.  Braces are
written ``\\lbrace`` / ``\\rbrace`` because GitHub's Markdown would otherwise
eat the backslash of ``\\{``.

The definitions follow W.M.P. van der Aalst, *Workflow Verification: Finding
Control-Flow Errors Using Petri-Net-Based Techniques* (2000) and *Process
Mining: Data Science in Action* (2016), with the notation of the course.
