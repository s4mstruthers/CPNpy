"""State-based regions: from a transition system to a Petri net.

Definitions (Cortadella et al. 1998; van der Aalst, *Process Mining*, Section 7.4.2)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Let ``TS = (S, E, T, s_in)`` be a transition system.

region
    A set of states ``R ⊆ S`` such that, for every event ``e``, *all*
    transitions labelled ``e`` do the same thing with respect to ``R``:
    they all **enter** it (start outside, end inside), all **exit** it
    (start inside, end outside), or all **do not cross** it (both ends
    inside, or both outside).  ``∅`` and ``S`` are the trivial regions.  The
    complement of a region is a region too (enter and exit swap).
minimal region
    A non-empty region that contains no smaller non-empty region.
pre-region / post-region
    ``R`` is a pre-region of ``e`` if ``e`` exits ``R``, a post-region if
    ``e`` enters it.  A region is a place in disguise: its pre-events put a
    token in, its post-events take it out.
generalised excitation region
    ``GER(e)``: the states in which ``e`` is enabled.
elementary transition system
    One that satisfies
    *state separation* -- any two distinct states are told apart by some
    region (one is inside it, the other is not) -- and
    *forward closure* -- for every event, the intersection of its
    pre-regions is exactly ``GER(e)``, i.e. the places before ``e`` are
    marked only where ``e`` really is enabled.

Synthesis
---------
One place per minimal region, an arc ``R → e`` for each pre-region and
``e → R`` for each post-region, and a token in every minimal region that
contains ``s_in``.  For an elementary transition system the reachability
graph of the result is isomorphic to the transition system (checked by
:func:`synthesise`).

Finding the regions
-------------------
Course-sized transition systems are solved exactly: every assignment of the
states to inside/outside is explored, abandoning an assignment as soon as two
transitions with the same event cross it differently.  That is the same as
checking every subset of states, only much faster, and it is limited to
:data:`MAX_STATES` states (and :data:`MAX_REGIONS` regions); the result says
when a limit cut it short.  (Larger systems need the expansion algorithm of
Cortadella et al., which is not implemented.)
