"""Discovery with state-based regions: log → transition system → Petri net.

The standard example of *two-phase* discovery (van der Aalst, *Process
Mining*, Section 7.4):

1. build a **transition system** from the log with a state function
   (:func:`~cpnpy.mining.transition_system.transition_system_from_log`):
   the prefix, postfix or both of every event, as a sequence, multiset or
   set, over a horizon of the last ``k`` events or all of them;
2. find its **regions** and **minimal regions**
   (:func:`~cpnpy.mining.regions.analyse_regions`), and check whether it is
   **elementary** (state separation and forward closure);
3. **synthesise** a Petri net with one place per minimal region
   (:func:`~cpnpy.mining.regions.synthesise`).  For an elementary
   transition system the net's reachability graph is isomorphic to it.

The abstraction is the knob: a coarser one (a set, a short horizon) merges
states and so generalises, a finer one (the full sequence) only allows the
log.  The result keeps every step so the app can show the derivation.
