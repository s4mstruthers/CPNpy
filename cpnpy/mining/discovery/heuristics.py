"""Heuristics Miner: frequency-aware dependency graphs (Weijters & van der Aalst).

Where the α-algorithm asks the yes/no question "does a ever directly precede
b?", the Heuristics Miner asks *how strongly* the log supports ``a`` causing
``b``, using counts ``|a >_L b|`` (how often b directly follows a):

Dependency measure, for ``a ≠ b``::

             |a > b| − |b > a|
    a ⇒ b = ───────────────────        value in (−1, 1)
             |a > b| + |b > a| + 1

It is close to 1 when b follows a often and a almost never follows b, close
to 0 when both orders are equally common (concurrency, or noise), negative
when the dependency is the other way round.  The ``+ 1`` damps small counts:
one occurrence gives only 0.5, a hundred give 0.99.

Length-one loop (``a`` directly followed by itself)::

    a ⇒ a = |a > a| / (|a > a| + 1)

Length-two loop (``a b a`` patterns, counted as ``|a >> b|``)::

    a ⇒2 b = (|a >> b| + |b >> a|) / (|a >> b| + |b >> a| + 1)

An edge ``a → b`` is kept when ``a ⇒ b`` reaches the *dependency threshold*
and ``|a > b|`` reaches the *positive observations* threshold.  With
*all tasks connected* on (the default), every activity additionally keeps its
single best incoming and outgoing edge, so no activity is left floating.

The output of :func:`heuristics_miner` is a *dependency graph*: which
activity causes which, without saying whether a fork is a choice (XOR) or
runs in parallel (AND).

From dependency graph to Petri net (:func:`heuristics_net`)
-----------------------------------------------------------
The split/join semantics come from the log, as a **causal net** (C-net,
van der Aalst, *Process Mining*, 2016, Section 7.3).  Every activity gets a
set of *input bindings* and *output bindings*: which of its predecessors it
waited for, and which of its successors it enabled.  Replaying each trace
on the dependency graph gives them:

* the output binding of ``a`` at position ``i`` is every successor ``b`` of
  ``a`` that occurs after ``i`` with no other ``a`` in between (its first
  such occurrence);
* the input binding of ``b`` at position ``j`` is every predecessor ``a``
  of ``b`` that occurs before ``j`` with no other ``b`` in between.

These two rules match up exactly: ``b`` is in ``a``'s output binding iff
``a`` is in the input binding of that occurrence of ``b``.  A virtual start
activity precedes the first event of every trace and a virtual end activity
follows the last one.  So after ``a`` in ``[⟨a,b,c,d⟩³, ⟨a,c,b,d⟩², ⟨a,e,d⟩]``,
``{b, c}`` (5 times) and ``{e}`` (once) are the output bindings: b and c
run in parallel, as an alternative to e.

The C-net becomes a Petri net in the standard way: a place for every arc
``(a, b)`` of the dependency graph, a transition per activity, and where an
activity has several bindings on a side, a silent transition per binding
that takes (or fills) exactly the places of that binding.  Silent steps that
make no difference to the behaviour are then removed.
