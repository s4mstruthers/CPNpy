"""Behavioural analysis of P/T nets: state spaces, properties, soundness.

Everything here answers questions of the form "can the net ever reach a
marking where ...?", so everything starts by exploring the markings the net
can reach.

Reachability graph
------------------
Nodes are the reachable markings, and an edge ``M --t--> M'`` means firing
``t`` in ``M`` gives ``M'``.  It is built breadth-first from the initial
marking.  It is finite iff the net is **bounded** (no place can hold an
unbounded number of tokens).

Coverability graph (Karp–Miller)
--------------------------------
For an unbounded net the reachability graph is infinite, so it cannot be
built.  The coverability graph is a finite over-approximation: when a new
marking ``M'`` *strictly covers* an ancestor ``M`` on its path (``M' ≥ M`` and
``M' ≠ M``), the difference can be pumped forever by repeating the same
firing sequence, so every place where ``M'(p) > M(p)`` is set to **ω**
("arbitrarily many").  ω is represented by ``math.inf``, which already obeys
``ω + n = ω - n = ω``.

Properties (course lecture "Petri net properties")
--------------------------------------------------
bounded / k-bounded / safe
    Every place holds at most k tokens in every reachable marking (safe:
    k = 1).  Read off the coverability graph: bounded iff no ω appears.
deadlock-free
    No reachable marking in which nothing is enabled.
dead transition
    A transition that can never fire (no edge carries it).
live transition
    From *every* reachable marking the transition can eventually fire again.
    In a finite graph: it must occur inside every *bottom* SCC (a strongly
    connected component with no way out), because the net always ends up
    trapped in some bottom SCC.
reversible
    The initial marking can be reached back from every reachable marking.

Soundness of workflow nets (van der Aalst, Workflow Verification, Def. 2 & 3)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A **WF-net** has one source place ``i`` (empty pre-set), one sink place ``o``
(empty post-set), and every node lies on a path from ``i`` to ``o``.
It is **sound** iff, starting from ``[i]``:

1. *option to complete* -- from every reachable marking, ``[o]`` is reachable;
2. *proper completion* -- if a reachable marking has a token in ``o``, it is
   exactly ``[o]`` (no tokens left behind);
3. *no dead transitions* -- every transition can fire in some reachable
   marking.

A sound WF-net is necessarily bounded, so if exploration finds the net to be
unbounded we can stop and report unsoundness.  (The paper's Theorem 1 gives
the equivalent formulation: N is sound iff the short-circuited net, with an
extra transition from ``o`` back to ``i``, is live and bounded.)

    Theorem 1 of the paper: N is sound **iff** (N̄, [i]) is *live* and
    *bounded*.  Why this works, informally:

    * t* can only fire once a case has finished with a token in ``o``; it
      starts the next case.  So "every transition can always fire again"
      (live) includes "t* can always fire again", i.e. every case can
      finish -- option to complete.  And it includes every ordinary
      transition, so none is dead.
    * If a case could finish with tokens left behind, t* would start the
      next case on top of them; cycling like that piles tokens up without
      limit -- unbounded.  So bounded rules out improper completion.

    Deadlock-freedom is weaker than liveness (a live net never deadlocks,
    but a net can keep going in a loop while some transition is dead), so
    it is shown for information only.  Note that N itself always stops in
    [o]; in N̄ that marking enables t*, so there deadlocks mean "stuck".
