"""Where CPNpy's notation and algorithms come from.

Every algorithm and notation convention CPNpy implements follows a published
source.  This module lists them once:

* :data:`REFERENCES` -- the works, as full citations;
* :data:`TOPICS` -- what CPNpy does, grouped as in the app, with the works it
  follows and the module that implements it.

The app shows this as *Help ▸ References*, and ``docs/references.md`` is
generated from it with ``python -m cpnpy.references > docs/references.md``
(a test checks the two agree).  Module docstrings cite the same works at the
point of use, often down to the definition or section.
