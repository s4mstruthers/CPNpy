"""Working in a folder such as "Week 2".

Opening a folder (File ▸ Open Folder…) makes the sidebar list every event
log and Petri net in it, opened or not, and keeps the folder and the app in
step.  Internally the open folder is a :class:`Workspace`; the app only ever
calls it a folder.  This module is the part that does not need Qt:

* :meth:`Workspace.tree` / :meth:`Workspace.files` -- the subfolders and the
  files in the folder the app can open;
* :meth:`Workspace.load_state` / :meth:`Workspace.save_state` -- which of
  them were open, so the folder comes back as you left it;
* :meth:`Workspace.settings` / :meth:`Workspace.update_settings` -- choices
  made for this folder (the sidebar's view, expanded subfolders, what to do
  with files opened from elsewhere);
* :func:`unique_path` and :func:`atomic_write` -- naming and writing the
  files the app creates in the folder;
* :func:`exercise_files` -- whether a folder is an *exercise* (it has a
  ``question`` file) and which of its files play which part.

The state lives in a small hidden JSON file, ``.cpnpy``, inside the folder;
the folder's scratch notes (✎ Notes) in another, ``.cpnpy notes.md``.
Paths in it are relative to the folder, so the workspace still works after
the folder is moved, renamed or synced to another computer (iCloud, a USB
stick, a Git repository).
