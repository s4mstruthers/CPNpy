"""State space (reachability graph) generation and analysis.

What a state space is
---------------------
Simulation shows you *one* behaviour of a model.  The state space shows you
*all* of them: every marking reachable from the initial one, and every binding
element leading between them.  From that graph you can prove properties rather
than sample them -- that the model never deadlocks, that a place never holds
more than three tokens, that every transition can eventually occur.

The graph
---------
* **Node**: a :class:`State`, i.e. a marking together with the model clock (the
  clock matters, because the same marking at two different times can behave
  differently in a timed net).
* **Arc**: a binding element that leads from one state to another.

Generation is a plain breadth-first search with a visited set.  Because
markings are hashable and immutable, the visited set is an ordinary Python
``set`` and equality does the work.

The properties we compute, and how
----------------------------------
``Best integer bounds``
    For each place, the largest and smallest number of tokens it holds across
    all reachable markings.  Direct scan.

``Best upper multiset bounds``
    The smallest multiset that dominates every reachable marking of a place,
    i.e. the pointwise maximum of the coefficients.  Also a direct scan.

``Dead markings``
    Nodes with no outgoing arcs.  These are the states the model can get stuck
    in; an empty list is the usual definition of "the model does not deadlock".

``Dead / live transitions``
    Computed from the **strongly connected component** (SCC) graph.  Condensing
    each SCC to a single node turns the state space into a DAG, and the DAG's
    *terminal* components (no arcs leaving them) are the sets of states the
    system ends up cycling within forever.  A transition is
    :term:`live` exactly when it occurs somewhere inside **every** terminal
    component -- meaning that no matter where the system settles, that
    transition can still happen again.  A transition is *dead* when it occurs
    on no arc at all.

``Home markings``
    A marking you can always get back to.  In SCC terms: if the condensed
    graph has exactly one terminal component, every state in it is a home
    marking, because every path eventually reaches that component.  If there is
    more than one, no home markings exist.

Tarjan's algorithm is used for the SCCs, written iteratively so that a state
space of a hundred thousand nodes does not blow the Python recursion limit.

Bounding the search
-------------------
Many interesting models have infinite state spaces.  :meth:`StateSpace.generate`
therefore takes ``max_nodes``; hitting the cap sets :attr:`StateSpace.partial`,
and the report says so, because properties computed from a partial state space
are *not* proofs.
