"""PyInstaller recipe for the standalone OpenProcess Studio app.

Build with ``python packaging/build.py`` (which runs this file and then packs
the result), or directly with ``pyinstaller packaging/openprocess.spec``.

PyInstaller collects a Python interpreter, the openprocess package and the parts of
Qt the app imports into one folder, ``dist/OpenProcess/``.  On macOS that folder is
then wrapped as ``dist/OpenProcess.app``.  PyInstaller cannot cross-compile: each
system builds its own app, which is why the GitHub workflow runs this on a
macOS, a Windows and a Linux machine.

This file is Python, run by PyInstaller with a few names predefined:
``SPECPATH`` (this folder), ``Analysis``, ``PYZ``, ``EXE``, ``COLLECT`` and
``BUNDLE``.
